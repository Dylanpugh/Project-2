<h3> For project #2 our group decided to increase the functionality of project 1 of the wikiflixx application. This included andding back-end data base functionality, authentication, and the use of the Heroku platforms.  These were completed based on the instructional informaion gaind since the last project and internet research.</br>In short summary, the aplpication is first designed to display new release movies for the upcoming year with the abily to filter by month or genre. The user is then able to access previews of the site on the page directly as displayed.  Additiionally guests at the site are encourages to create a login id and password.  After that is created, the user can complete a short survey about thier favorite genre, actors, and movies. </br>
In future developments the plans to add more functionality:
<ul>
    <li>Search Functionality from primary page for movei or actor</li>
    <li>Algorithm build to pull in recommended movies based on the 5 movies selected in the survey and stored in the DB</li>
    <li>DB logic to pull upcoming movies based on favirite actors</li>
    <li>Email updates to users for thier recomended movies</li>
</ul>
Some of the newer technologies since project #1 used in the version two of the application include:
<ul>
    <li>Semantics-UI CSS package</li>
    <li>JavaScript Node</li>
    <li>my SQL and Sequelize</li>
    <li>Heroku Deplpoyment with JawsDB</li>
    <li>User Authentication for All Pages</li>
    <li>Handlebars extension packages rather than full HTML pages</li>
</ul>
